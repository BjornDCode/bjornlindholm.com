A modern editor that's focused on being fast. It seems like it can be a modern version of Sublime which I think is one of the best apps ever made. Speed was the main issue I've never gotten used to VSCode.

The people behind Zed have some interesting ideas for collaborating, but I mostly work solo so I don't know how useful they will be to me.
