On an input event from a input element you would use <InlineCode>event.target.value</InlineCode> to get the value.

But if it's a normal HTML elemenent with the <InlineCode>contenteditable</InlineCode> attribute that doesn't work. Instead you can use <InlineCode>event.target.textContent</InlineCode>.
